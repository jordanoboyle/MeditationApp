## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, I recommend using the **Live Server** extension in VSCode. Itâ€™s a straightforward and enjoyable way to serve your project.

- **Live Server Extension**: [ritwickdey.LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

### Instructions

1. **Install Live Server**: If you haven't installed the Live Server extension, you can do so from the VSCode marketplace.
2. **Open the Project**: Open the `index.html` file in your VSCode.
3. **Start the Server**:
   - Right-click on the `index.html` file and select **Open with Live Server**.
   - Alternatively, click on the **Go Live** button in the bottom right corner of VSCode.
4. **Access the Application**: Your browser should automatically open with a local server running on port `5500`.

If you prefer using another local server like MAMP, feel free to do so.


## Customization
This is open-source and the code is free to be cloned and used as needed. Some of the CSS is a bit wonky because I am testing different ideas.
